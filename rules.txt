CareAdvisors Junior Software Developer Code Test!
	Intro
		Hi, potential teammate! Thanks for showing interest in CareAdvisors and our mission. In this part of the
		interview process, we want to test out your technical chops. We care more about your thinking process more
		than getting to the optimal, most efficient solution (or even a solution at all!). Below are instructions for our
		code test.
		This test should not take more than 10 hours to complete.

	Story
		Due to a glitch in the newly released Teleportron 5500, what should have been a quick trip to Chipotle has
		turned into you (and your rumbling stomach) landing in a distant, sandy planet called "Gorbyoyo" with unhappy
		inhabitants. 
		The planet's inhabitants, Gorbyoyos, a human-like creature who walks backwards, have recently
		been bombarded with interstellar solicitors hawking Cutko knives, and are no longer taking kindly to strangers.
		The Gorbyoyo's have spotted you and are walking backwards towards you. 
		Fortunately, because walking backwards is so inefficient and they frequently bump into each other as their closing in on you, 
		this gives you enough time to create a translator to let the Gorbyoyo's that you come in peace. 
		You have two tools at your disposal: 
		an interstellar API that let's you translate English to a language similar to Gorbyoyo called Dorbdorb and a guide that translates Dorbdorb to Gorbyoyo.

	Your goal is to
		Create a full stack web application
		Read and understand the instructions to translate a string of Dorbdorb to Gorbyoyo
		Create a function that calls the interstellar Dorbdorb translation API that takes an English string as an

	Input
		Using Dorbdorb to Gorbyoyo translation guidelines, code in a function to translate the payload
		Check with the translation verification API to make sure the translation is correct
		Output the correct translation to the screen using a specific style that Gorboyoyo's can only read
		Gorbyoyos can only read large, brightly-colored, centered text on a dark background
		Store the correct translation in a database so that if you refresh the page, you can still display the correct translation

	Which technologies to use
		Use whatever tools/languages/libraries you're most comfortable with
		We care about your problem-solving thought-process more than the specific technology you use

	What to submit
		Upload your solution onto Github
		Include documentation wherever you think is necessary
		Include steps to reproduce project locally, including creating the database
		Front-end OR back-end tests (your choice)

	Translation Instructions
		The response you get when you hit the Dorbdorb API is an array of strings. 
			Ex.[<INTEGER_A><ALPHA_1><INTEGER_B>, <INTEGER_A><ALPHA_2><INTEGER_B>,...,<INTEGER_A><ALPHA_N><INTEGER_B>]
		Each string will have this structure: <INTEGER_A><ALPHA><INTEGER_B>
		To translate Dorbdorb to Gorbyoyo, 
			sum INTEGER_A and INTEGER_B 
			concatenate with <ALPHA>yo
			So <INTEGER_A><ALPHA><INTEGER_B> translates to
		<ALPHA>yo<SUM_OF_INTEGER_A_AND_B> . 
		
		Ex. Gorbyoyo 10L13 translates to Lyo23

		Each <INTEGER> has two or three digits, and each <ALPHA> has one letter
		
		Submit the translation as a string to the verification endpoint for validation. 
		If it's validated, then display	the correct translation on the screen
		The phrase that you want to communicate to the Gorbyoyo's is "i am not selling knives".
		Input English string should be all LOWERCASE and have no punctuation.

	Endpoints
		Translate from English to Dorbdorb: 
			https://72exx40653.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/translateEnglishToAlien
		POST with body { textToTranslate: "TEXT" } , where textToTranslate is a string
		Response will be either error message or array
		Verify Gorbyoyo translation: 
			https://72exx40653.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/confirmtranslation
		POST with body { textToVerify: "TEXT" } , where textToVerify is a string
		Response will be either "Invalid Translation" or "Success" . Both are strings
