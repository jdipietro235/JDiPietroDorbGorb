Come on and slam, and welcome to the jam

Its Friday, 10-30.
Hello Justin - thank you for taking the time to speak with Pradeep regarding the Software Engineer I role. We would like to move forward with next steps in the hiring process. The next step is a simple code test - see the attached document for step-by-step instructions. If you can complete the code test and make your submission by Wednesday, 11/4, that would be great!

On Wednesday (11/4) you can send Pradeep and I a link to the Github where your work is located.

Feel free to reach out to Pradeep Keshary (pradeep@care-advisors.com) with any questions or concerns about the code test.
 
Thank you and we are excited to review your work!




STEP 1:
	what tools should I use?
	Probably React, Node, and MySQL, since thats on the job desc

Step 2:
	Google how to create webserver with Node

Step 3:
	Deciding on Database proved frustrating, so I'm putting it off until later

... giving up on steps ...

going to set up an exchange where the user sends a string to the server
then the server saves that string with the cookie
then the user always has that string in their page


Things I considered doing:
	Implementing connection pooling for Database connections
	Conneciton pooling is useful when a server high traffic. 
	I am designing this system for roughly 1 user at a time, so high traffic isn't a factor.

Lessons learned:
	Async continues to be a huge pain when it comes to databases
